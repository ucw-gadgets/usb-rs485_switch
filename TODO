== Things to be fixed in HW ==

  - GND and GND2 must be connected for VBUS power to work.

  - The PIN pin of ADuM4160 should be connected to GPIO0, so that
    USB can be disconnected in firmware. (If software control were not
    needed, PIN should be connected to VDD2 on the same chip.)

  - D+ at downstream side of the ADuM4160 has to be pulled up to 3V3
    by a 1k5 resistor.

  - Green LEDs are too dim â€“ the 2k7 resistor between PWRENn and the
    LED is too big.

  - Inputs + and - of the INA180A1 amplifier are swapped.

  - Voltage limit for VIN (printed next to the power connector)
    should be decreased to 26V because of INA180A1.

  - Bias resistors are swapped: A should be biased to +, B to -,
    so that the idle state of the line is H.

== Firmware ==

  - Measuring transaction times and switch load.

  - After some testing, increase MAX_IN_FLIGHT in firmware.h.

  - Measuring of current (needs HW fixes).

== Daemon ==

  - Counters on TCP MODBUS events?

  - Better MODBUS ID strings

== MODBUS library ==

  - Enforce inter-frame gaps.
