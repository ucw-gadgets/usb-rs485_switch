== Things to be fixed in HW ==

- GND and GND2 must be connected for VBUS power to work.

- The PIN pin of ADuM4160 should be connected to GPIO0, so that
  USB can be disconnected in firmware. (If software control were not
  needed, PIN should be connected to VDD2 on the same chip.)

- D+ at downstream side of the ADuM4160 has to be pulled up to 3V3
  by a 1k5 resistor.

- Green LEDs are too dim â€“ the 2k7 resistor between PWRENn and the
  LED is too big.

- Inputs + and - of the INA180A1 amplifier are swapped.

- Voltage limit for VIN (printed next to the power connector)
  should be decreased to 26V because of INA180A1.

- Bias resistors are swapped: A should be biased to +, B to -,
  so that the idle state of the line is H.

== Firmware ==

- Add serial number to USB descriptors not only in DFU mode

- Enforce minimal inter-packet times.

- Numbering of ports: internally, we are using 0 (right) to 7 (left).
  Should we use 1 (left) to 8 (right) in user-facing parts?

== Daemon ==

- Configuration

- Default name of configuration file

- Port settings

- Control requests

- Turn off LOCAL_DEBUG

- Limit maximum # of connected clients

- Limit maximum # of queued messages per client

- Support multiple switches simultaneously:
	- use USB hot-plug
	- configuration of multiple boxes
	- match boxes by USB serial numbers
