== Things to be fixed in HW ==

- GND and GND2 must be connected for VBUS power to work.

- The PIN pin of ADuM4160 should be connected to GPIO0, so that
  USB can be disconnected in firmware. (If software control were not
  needed, PIN should be connected to VDD2 on the same chip.)

- D+ at downstream side of the ADuM4160 has to be pulled up to 3V3
  by a 1k5 resistor.

- Green LEDs are too dim â€“ the 2k7 resistor between PWRENn and the
  LED is too big.
